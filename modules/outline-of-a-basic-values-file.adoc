= Outline of a basic values file

A values file typically consists of three main sections:

. *Global*: Global values refer to configuration settings for use across multiple charts within a deployment. These values are shared among various charts to avoid redundancy of configuration settings, promoting consistency. Each pattern includes a `values-global.yaml` file, with configurations automatically incorporated into the application specification processed by the GitOps operator.

. *Main*: Main values encompass the overall configuration settings, including those specific to ClusterGroups and the shared configurations defined in the values-global.yaml.
These values collectively represent the comprehensive set of configurations that define the behavior and characteristics of the entire pattern deployment.
These might include both ClusterGroup-specific overrides and global configurations from the `values-global.yaml`, ensuring a cohesive and unified set of settings for the deployment.

. *ClusterGroup*: The ClusterGroup defines a collection of applications, typically represented as Helm charts, that constitute a specific pattern deployment. It allows the incorporation of various applications in the deployment, providing flexibility to establish specific overrides or configurations for each chart individually.
For example, in scenarios like retail, a pattern may include multiple ClusterGroups, each representing different aspects or locations within the overall deployment.
