= Outline of a basic values file

In a values file, each variable declares an element with a default value, influencing Helm templates and guiding validated patterns. As files or overrides enter the rendering pipeline, they replace default values in the values files, following the principle that the last value takes precedence for adaptability.

The three-fold distinction in validated patterns, "Global," "Main," and "ClusterGroup," practically applies the Helm override scheme. While "main" and "global" terms are used interchangeably, Helm differentiates by allowing "global" variables to extend to sub-charts, ensuring comprehensive configuration access. Values files, structured in free-form YAML, provide flexibility for any YAML variable type and are organized into Global, Main, and ClusterGroup configurations. 

In Validated patterns, values files follow Helm rules, but the "global" and "ClusterGroup" sections have distinct meanings within this framework.

[NOTE]
====
Increasingly, more value files are designed solely for overriding base chart values. These files may not always have "ClusterGroup," "Main," or "Global" values. The decision to include these sections depends on the specific overrides required for each case.

*Key sections of values files*:

Global:: Global values refer to configuration settings shared across multiple charts within a deployment. These values are distributed among various charts to avoid redundancy and configuration setting repetition, promoting consistency.
Each pattern includes a `values-global.yaml` file, which contains configurations that are automatically incorporated into the application specification processed by the GitOps operator.


ClusterGroup:: The ClusterGroup holds a specific significance within validated patterns. It defines clusters that are anticipated to share nearly identical configurations, serving a common architectural purpose. A ClusterGroup may consist of one or many members. Conventionally, there is a main ClusterGroup defined in `main.clusterGroupName` in `values-global.yaml`, acting as the hub or starting point for each pattern. Additional ClusterGroups can be managed by the main ClusterGroup through tools like Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM).

[NOTE]
====
Not all value files contain a ClusterGroup section; instead `values-global` sets the starting point, and these value files can subsequently define managed clusters.
