= About Helm and ArgoCD

ArgoCD integrates with Helm to provide a powerful GitOps-based deployment mechanism. By defining applications as Helm charts and managing them through ArgoCD, you can achieve automated, declarative, and version-controlled deployments in your Kubernetes cluster.

The Validated Patterns framework is built around ArgoCD/OpenShift GitOps Operator is uses Helm to install and configure operators, not replace them. 

ArgoCD within validated patterns uses Helm directly
