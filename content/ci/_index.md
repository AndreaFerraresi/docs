These are the latest results of the Validated Patterns CI test runs.

**NOTE:** Some jobs are currently failing prior to pattern deployment due to [timeouts while deploying OpenShift](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-10439).

Subsequent versions of this page will differentiate between failures prior to pattern installation, and those in the pattern tests.
