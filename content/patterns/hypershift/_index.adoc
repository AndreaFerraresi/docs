= About the {hcp-pattern} ({hcp})

Background::

This pattern is designed and intended to assist with simplifying the deployment of an {hcp} Hosting cluster. When this pattern is deployed, users will be be able to create hostedclusters of their own.

Workflow::

* Install multicluster-engine operator
* Create an instance of the multicluster-engine which enables the tech preview feature `hypershift`
* Install the AWS Controller for Kubernetes (ACK) operator for S3
* Create an S3 bucket to be used by HyperShift for OIDC
* Create a buildconfig and imagestream that provide the HyperShift cli (`hypershift`) as an imagestream to be used in further automation if desired.
