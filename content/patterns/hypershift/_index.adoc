= About the {med-pattern}

Background::

This pattern is designed and intended to assist with simplifying the deployment of a HyperShift Hosting cluster. When this pattern is deployed, users will be be able to create hostedclusters of their own.

Workflow::

* Install multicluster-engine operator
* Create an instance of the multicluster-engine which enables the tech preview feature `hypershift`
* Install the AWS Controller for Kubernetes (ACK) operator for S3
* Create an S3 bucket to be used by HyperShift for OIDC
* Create a buildconfig and imagestream that provide the HyperShift cli (`hypershift`) as an imagestream to be used in further automation if desired.

This pipeline is showcased link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zja83FVsm14[in this video].

== About the solution elements

The solution aids the understanding of the following:

* How to use a GitOps approach to keep in control of configuration and operations.
* How to deploy AI/ML technologies for medical diagnosis using GitOps.

The {med-pattern} uses the following products and technologies:

* {rh-ocp} for container orchestration
* {rh-gitops}, a GitOps continuous delivery (CD) solution
* {rh-amq-first}, an event streaming platform based on the Apache Kafka
* {rh-serverless-first} for event-driven applications
* {rh-ocp-data-first} for cloud native storage capabilities
* {grafana-op} to manage and share Grafana dashboards, data sources, and so on
* S3 storage

== About the architecture

[IMPORTANT]
====
Presently, the {med-pattern} does not have an edge component. Edge deployment capabilities are planned as part of the pattern architecture for a future release.

Components are running on OpenShift either at the data center, at the medical facility, or public cloud running OpenShift.
