Secrets in validated patterns are configurations that securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and certificates, required by applications running in an OpenShift cluster. These secrets are defined and managed as part of the overall validated pattern to ensure consistent, secure, and compliant deployments.

Secrets in validated patterns are crucial for managing sensitive information securely and consistently across OpenShift deployments. They relate directly to OpenShift secrets by leveraging Kubernetes Secret objects, ensuring that applications can securely access necessary confidential data. Defining secrets in validated patterns promotes best practices for security, compliance, and ease of management, integrating seamlessly with the overall application deployment process.
