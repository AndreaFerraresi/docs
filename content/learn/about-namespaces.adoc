= About Namespaces

Namespaces in a validated pattern are essential for organizing and managing resources within an OpenShift cluster, ensuring security, consistency, and efficient resource allocation. Recommendations for defining namespaces include using consistent naming conventions, ensuring isolation and security through policies and RBAC, setting resource quotas, tailoring configurations to specific environments, and designing namespaces for modularity and reusability across patterns or applications.
