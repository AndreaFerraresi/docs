== About the {solution-name-upstream} tiers

To know about the patterns that you can use and contribute towards, understand the following pattern tiers:

|===
|Pattern tier|Description

|{sandbox-tier-first}
|A pattern categorized under the {sandbox} tier is an inclusive and low-risk way to become associated with the {solution-name-upstream} project. The minimum requirement to qualify for the {sandbox} tier is that you must start with the patterns framework and include minimal documentation.
The patterns in this tier might be in a work-in-progress state; and they might have been manually tested and on a limited set of platforms.


|{tested-tier-first}
|A pattern categorized under theThe {tested} tier provides you with additional collateral and reassurance that the pattern was known to be recently working on at least one recent version of {rh-ocp}. Inclusion in this tier requires some additional work for the pattern’s owner - which might be a partner or a sufficiently motivated Subject Matter Expert (SME).

|{maintained-tier-first}
| intended to provide consumers with additional "sales" collateral and reassurance that the pattern was known to be functional on all currently supported LTS versions of OpenShift. Inclusion in this tier may require additional work for the pattern’s owner - which might be a partner or sufficiently motivated SME.
