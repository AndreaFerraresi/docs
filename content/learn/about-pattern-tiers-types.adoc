== About the {solution-name-upstream} tiers

To contribute to the patterns that suit your usecase or to learn about onboarding your own pattern, understand the following pattern tiers.

|===
|Pattern tier|Description

|{sandbox-tier-first}
|A pattern categorized under the {sandbox} tier provides you with an entry-point to onboard to the {solution-name-upstream}. The minimum requirement to qualify for the {sandbox} tier is that you must start with the patterns framework and include minimal documentation.

These patterns in this tier might be in a work-in-progress state; and they might have been manually tested on a limited set of platforms.


|{tested-tier-first}
|A pattern categorized under the {tested} tier implies that the pattern was known to be recently working on at least one recent version of {rh-ocp}. Qualifying for this tier might require  additional work for the pattern’s owner, who might be a partner or a sufficiently motivated subject matter expert (SME).
//Additional work such as?
These patterns in this tier might have a defined business problem with demonstration. The patterns  might have a test plan - manual or automated, which passes at least once for each new {rh-ocp} minor version.

|{maintained-tier-first}
|A pattern categorized under the {tested} tier implies that the pattern was known to be functional on all currently supported extended update support (EUS) versions of {rh-ocp}. Qualifying for this tier might require additional work for the pattern’s owner who might be a partner or a sufficiently motivated SME.

These patterns  might have a formal release process with z-streams They might have continuous integration (CI) automation testing.
